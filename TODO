Telescope
=========

Set up telescope functions with the <leader>t lead-in
- s : grep search
- add hotkey to open in split or tab (maybe shift-enter)

Diary
=====

I want to set up a nice diary flow. This would include:

Telescope picker to find/select files in the $diary directory
Shell script/alias to quickly create/edit a diary file


Git workflow
------------

I find that staging through status is cludgy, especially when there are a lot of
untracked files in my worktree. Instead, I have started to do:

:Git add %
:Git commit -m "message"

Some shortcut sequences for those could be very useful
