Telescope
=========

Set up telescope functions with the <leader>t lead-in
- [ ] s : grep search
- [ ] add hotkey to open in split or tab (maybe <C-v>, <C-h>, <C-t> )
    - this seems to be done already, with these keys
- [ ] allow file creation from the find_files builtin

LSP
===

- [ ] figure out why lua doesn't work right
- [ ] add hotkeys for some of the telescope lsp builtins

Diary
=====

I want to set up a nice diary flow. This would include:

- [x] Telescope picker to find/select files in the $diary directory
- [ ] Shell script/alias to quickly create/edit a diary file
- [ ] Markdown folding (via tree-sitter?)

Color
=====

Probably simplify my colorscheme file. It feels too gargantuan to manage.

Git workflow
------------

I find that staging through status is cludgy, especially when there are a lot of
untracked files in my worktree. Instead, I have started to do:

:Git add %
:Git commit -m "message"

Some shortcut sequences for those could be very useful
