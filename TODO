Telescope

Set up telescope functions with the <leader>t lead-in
- h : help
- e : edit

Git workflow
------------

I find that staging through status is cludgy, especially when there are a lot of
untracked files in my worktree. Instead, I have started to do:

:Git add %
:Git commit -m "message"

Some shortcut sequences for those could be very useful
