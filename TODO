LaTeX
=====

I'm starting to see ways that Treesitter + Telescope can help with my latex
writing. Here are a few options:
- Bibtex: 
    - use a treesitter query to find the included bibtex file
    - query that file for all the possible citation keywords
    - have a telescope picker that inserts a citation for me from the list
        - if in citation node, then just add selected
        - if outside citation node, create a new citation with all selected
- References:
    - treesitter can find all references
    - use telescope to select the reference that I want.

Telescope
=========

Set up telescope functions with the <leader>t lead-in
- [ ] s : grep search
- [ ] add hotkey to open in split or tab (maybe <C-v>, <C-h>, <C-t> )
    - this seems to be done already, with these keys
- [ ] allow file creation from the find_files builtin

LSP
===

- [ ] figure out why lua doesn't work right
- [ ] add hotkeys for some of the telescope lsp builtins

Diary
=====

I want to set up a nice diary flow. This would include:

- [X] Telescope picker to find/select files in the $diary directory
- [X] Shell script/alias to quickly create/edit a diary file
- [ ] Markdown folding (via tree-sitter?)

Color
=====

Probably simplify my colorscheme file. It feels too gargantuan to manage.

Git workflow
------------

I find that staging through status is cludgy, especially when there are a lot of
untracked files in my worktree. Instead, I have started to do:

:Git add %
:Git commit -m "message"

Some shortcut sequences for those could be very useful

Tree-Sitter
===========

I mostly installed this for folding, but the markdown document tree isn't
arranged well. This is because headings do not contain the following contents
in their tree.

To figure it out:
  - Can we change the grammar to add a tree structure to the document?
    - This is the way the latex parser works, and it folds really well
  - Possibly use a custom folding function and queries to do it
